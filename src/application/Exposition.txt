Huh? Where am I? I began to open my eyes to the wreckage of the castle.
I can't seem to remember anything.

I stumbled up onto my feet. I seemed to be at the bottom of the mountain, yet I remember being at the top...
I dust off my battered armour and begin walking towards the broken down doors of the castle when suddenly...

"LET'S GET HIM. I HEARD HE'S WORTH GOOD MONEY IF WE DEFEAT HIM!"

Ugh, bad guys, let's hope I remember how to fight.
