"Phew. That was a tough fight." I heaved to myself as I picked up my sword.

"As skillful as ever." A mysterious voice echoed off the marble walls.
As I turn around, I see an old man, a wizard I assumed from his attire.

"Heh. It seems that you don't remember me. I'll bring you up to speed,
You and your father, the King were looking for the 'Legendary Weapon'
But it seems that you have failed, that beast at the top sure lives up to his name.
Your father has already left to pursue the weapon again...You should follow his steps.
The weapon holds the power to destroy all life if in the wrong hands..."

I remember now, father and I were atop the mountain at the temple of the beast.
I understand why the beast is protecting it, if it has the power to destroy life...
Thinking about it... I think I remember father mumbling that he needed to eradicate
enemies before they became threats to the kingdom.

...I must go and defeat my father before he gets ahold of it...

"Then we must make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands." I said while walking up
the stairs that lead to the mountain.
